					<h2> My Custom Dungeons and Dragons Game Utilizing Pointers and Virtual Functions (C++)</h2>
					<p>
						I consider this one of my very difficult projects where I overcame many obstacles
						in the way. I had to create a custom dungeon and dragons game where I utilized virtual
						functions, different header files, pointers, and many loops and iterations. I programmed
						the whole project using C++. <span id="dots4">...</span> <span id="more4">
							I reviewed my strategies list for best practices and ways to
							effectively use time and space complexity when writing my code. What I used a lot was
							feedback and peer reviews and creating a game that included many complex functions
							and challenging obstacles that I looked over until an SI leader, professor, or tutor pointed
							them out and provided advice.
							<br /> <br /> From inception, I created the code from scratch, I made sure to separate each
							project file using header files, so I could organize my code and make it readable.
							I created four different classes with their own private and public functions and
							data. There was the knight, who was the main character of the game, this player
							had a private healing dice function while their health, attack, and stats were
							shown in the public class. I also created a mage class where the public data was
							similar to the knights, but that character did not have any private data. The rogue
							class had similar features and functionality as the wizard/mage, but it also
							included a dodge function that lets the character randomly dodge an attack based
							on the rand() function. The common class was all the characteristics that were
							going to be used for the other characters and it is basically where most of the
							values are defined.
							ii. The source.cpp is the file that connects all the header files using #include that
							contain their own unique classes. The source code is where the code interacts
							with the user, and it is where most of the pointer functions and virtual functions
							are used because in order for the game to work it would need to point at values in
							other files to work accurately and effectively. This game took about 1-2 months
							to finish and after submitting it I received an outstanding score and great
							comments from my CPSC 121 professor at CSUF. <br /> <br />
							I ensure my code is efficient in terms of time and space complexity by first understanding
							the problem, choosing optimal and efficient algorithms, using correct data structures,
							minimizing or avoiding unnecessary operations, redundancies, iterations, and loops,
							analyzing my time and space complexity by looking at input sizes and potential
							bottlenecks, minimize memory usage, use built-in functions and libraries, and make sure
							to constantly review and improve my code.

							<h2 href="#"> Database Management System Using SQL </h2>

						<p>
							In my ISDS 402 course, Database Management Systems, I had one individual group
							project. This project required the usage of SQL and formulating designs such as entities,
							tables, and the primary and foreign keys. <span id="dots6">...</span> <span id="more6">
								This project required me to create a database,
								test it, and maintain it using code, computer programs, and applications. The assignment
								included eight steps.
								<br /> <br />
								i. Step 1.) I had to create as many entities as I needed to match the professor’s
								requirements and include the attributes that were asked in the project’s
								description. I created 6 entities with several attributes. Each entity had a primary
								key because I needed them to create foreign keys for certain entities that
								eventually connected all of them. I also created assumptions which are restraints
								that the entities require in order to work or function correctly. <br /> <br />
								ii. Step 2.) I created all the entities’ diagrams and used Crow Foot’s notation to
								connect each entity. I also provided a description of the diagrams, what crow foot
								notation was included, and why it was. There were 12 different relationships and
								I used MS Visio to create these diagrams. <br /> <br />
								iii. Step 3.) I created a matrix that included the fields, data type, field size, and
								description of each attribute for each entity. I created 6 matrixes. <br /> <br />
								iv. Step 4.) I created a script that had “create data tables and insert values.” This was
								to provide the foundation of the database and what it included. I had to type over
								200 lines of script of unique data for each attribute of each entity. Then I inputted
								them into SDL Management Studio where it generated a database and tables that
								I can review or look over when searching the database for certain data using SQL
								commands. <br /> <br />
								v. Step 5.) This was to look over the SQL Management Studio’s Diagrams and
								make sure that they were correct and accurate. I needed to look at the tables and
								diagrams to ensure that there were no redundancies or mistakes. <br /> <br />
								vi. Step 6.) I had to create an SQL statement that selected all the entities and
								displayed it at the bottom of the UI to ensure that the SQL commands could
								locate my database. <br /> <br />
								vii. Step 7.) I created several SQL statements such as “List the total sales for each
								dealer over a month’s time frame or List the amount due from NHD to each
								dealer after all deductions are considered in a particular month.” I provided
								excellent proficiency in the SQL codes as it pulled accurate and correct data. <br /> <br />
								viii. Step 8.) Answer all the professor’s questions in detail. The questions were about
								normalization and why it was a significant factor when defining a database
								design, how I validated a proposed database design model before implantation,
								what challenges I faced during the project, and what advice I could give to future
								ISDS 402 students. After completing the project, I received a score of 98 and
								wonderful comments on my proficiency in SQL and database management.

							This report is a statisitical analsis report that focuses on retention rates for Mont St. Michel Community
							College. In a group of five, we used different data analytic strategies to figure out what factors were the most
							significant in determining the retention rates. <span id="dots8">...</span> <span id="more8">
								We utilized SPSS, Advanced Excel tools, and Tableau. We created visualizations
								of each factor that could be related to the issue at hand and tested their significance using linear programming and logistic
								regression. We tested the data/factors multiple times through Classification Tables, Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients, Model Summarys,
								Hosmer and Lemeshow Test, and testing the variables in the Equation. After the tests, we chose the factor with the most
								significance and created a predictive model equation [P_Hat = 1/(1+EXP(-(b0)+(b1*x1)+(b2*x2)-....(bn*xn)]. The final number
								was put into a data table and the results showed the probability of the retention rate based on the signifcant factor.
