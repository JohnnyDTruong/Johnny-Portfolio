                        My name is Jonathan Truong, but you can call me Johnny. I am an aspiring technical worker that loves to learn.<br />
                        Growing up, I found it very difficult to see where I was going and I am sure that is how most people felt.
                        After finishing middle school, I began learning about the world of technology in a career perspective and why it is a significant factor<br />
                        in today's world. What caught my attention the most is software, and what many things you can achieve with it.
                        If I were to describe one word about myself, it would be <strong> innovative </strong> . I indulge in moments where I can build, make, develop,
                        generate, or create anything I want with technology, especially through coding.

                    I am a recent California State University-Fullerton graduate. I recently graduated this Fall, 2023,
                    with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems.
                    I chose this career path because of my love of learning different code languages, discovering software management competence, being innovative, business in an IT perspective and having fun with technology,
                    and just learning more about the world of technology in general. After finishing middle school, I started to think about my career, I have always loved technology
                    and what it can provide, so I decided from there on I will be focusing on it. It intrigues me and makes me happy to acquire technical skills.
                </p>

                    I currently work at Disney as a food service worker
                    and food prep worker and have worked there for over five years. I have met many friends and, I would say, some close friends throughout those years, and I love that Disney brings people together and allows us to interact with guests
                    and cast members and also create that magic that Disney is known for. I have also worked at Moss Adams as an IT Compliance and Consulting Intern.
                    This experience allowed me to gain more knowledge about system security, SOC Protocols, information technology, IT auditing, CyberSecurity,
                    Data Analyzing, Consulting, Excel RNGs, and most importantly, networking and making friends. D-Air Conditioning is another Internshship I Experienced
                    , where I learned about sales. I enjoyed working as a Sales Intern, but my love was in technology; However, I received many lessons and
                    skills such as, strengthening my skills with Excel and Quickbooks, and generating excellency in customer service in Vietnamese and English.
                    I have added many experiences to my list, but I am hungry for more. I think companies should give me a chance to show them what I am made of and
                    what I can bring to the table! My motivation to learn and grow will never stop, as <strong> Innovation </strong> will never end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my years, I have collected many hobbies and my favorites are: playing football with friends and family as this sport requires a significant amount of leadership,
                    hanging out with friends and family when it comes to outside events, trips, or outings, going to theme parks like Disneyland and Universal Studios,
                    going to the gym to relieve stress and relax, and enjoying every moment of my life with my dogs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What interests me is the world of Star Wars and how it began my journey with technology. Star wars opened my curiosity with hardware and software
                    as the world of the Galactic Republic was filled with advanced technology and how almost every character in the franchise's universe understood
                    technology and how to become a decent to advanced engineer. I love learning and adding to my knowledge, I find computer science, Information Systems, Data Science, and Software Engineering very intriguing and
                    have taken many courses in the CS world and self-taught many CS fundamentals. No matter the difficulty, the motivation I have to learn is robust.
                    Being able to gain new insights and focus on personal and professional growth through intellectual curiosity and understanding the desire for self-improvment
                    is a key characteristic to be engaged in as we will need it to stay ahead in this competitive and vastly changing world.
