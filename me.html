					<h1>
						This is Me
					</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Johnny Truong and I am an aspiring technical worker that loves to learn.<br />
						Growing up, I found it very difficult to see where I was going and I am sure that is how most people felt.
						After finishing middle school, I began learning about the world of technology and it why it is a significant factor<br />
						in today's world. What caught my attention the most is software, and what many things you can achieve with it.
						If I were to describe one word about myself, it would be innovative. I indulge in moments where I can build, make, develop,
						generate, or create anything I want with technology, especially through coding.

				<p> Living in this world for about 23 years, I have collected many hobbies and my favorites are: playing football with friends and family as this sport requires a significant amount of leadership,
				hanging out with friends and family when it comes to outside events, trips, or outings, going to theme parks like Disneyland and Universal Studios,
				going to the gym to relieve stress and relax, and enjoying every moment of my life with my dogs. </p>
				<p> What interests me is the world of Star Wars and how it began my journey with technology. Star wars opened my curiosity with hardware and software
				as the world of the Galactic Republic was filled with advanced technology and how almost every character in the franchise's universe understood
				technology and how to become a decent to advanced engineer. I love learning and adding to my knowledge, I find computer science, Information Systems, Data Science, and Software Engineering very intriguing and
				have taken many courses in the CS world and self-taught many CS fundamentals. No matter the difficulty, the motivation I have to learn is robust.
				Being able to gain new insights and focus on personal and professional growth through intellectual curiosity and understanding the desire for self-improvment
				is a key characteristic to be engaged in as we will need it to stay ahead in this competitive and vastly changing world. </p>
